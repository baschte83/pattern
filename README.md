# Pattern

### Assignment, class and language
This is my solution to the assignment **Pattern** of class **software developement 1,** written in Java.

### Requirements
This program needs an uneven integer value x from the terminal. It creates a square with a side length of x, made out of points ".", and the slants are made of "X". Here is an example with `x = 5`:  
```X...X  
.X.X.  
..X..  
.X.X.  
X...X
```   

If x is even or 0, the program prints **Invalid Input** on the screen. If x is uneven but negative, the program turns the negative value into a positive one.
